Problem Statement Scenario 

1. Since the first automobile, the Benz Patent Motor Car in 1886, Mercedes-Benz has stood for important automotive innovations. These include the passenger safety cell with a crumple zone, the airbag, and intelligent assistance systems. Mercedes-Benz applies for nearly 2000 patents per year, making the brand the European leader among premium carmakers. Mercedes-Benz is the leader in the premium car industry. With a huge selection of features and options, customers can choose the customized Mercedes-Benz of their dreams. 
 
2. To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach. 
 
3. In this competition, challenge is to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench, which consequently will decrease carbon dioxide emissions associated with the testing procedure. All required data for the Greener Manufacturing competition was provided by Mercedes-Benz. The dataset was collected from thousands of safety and reliability tests run on a variety of Mercedes vehicles. 
 
4. The evaluation metric for the competition is the R² measure, known as the coefficient of determination.
